# Stationary Items Selling Website

This is an example project on a Stationary Items selling website. Users can select from a wide variety of stationary items, sell items, and buy new items all from the comfort of their own place.Also, the important details of the user which they provide while performing the transactions are properly secured.

The tech stack used for this project includes Python (Django) and MongoDB for the database.

## Project Status

As of now, the work on this project has been completed. The items selling section is left untouched as I do not possess any stocks or items which can be displayed. This project is concluded for now and may be revisited in the future for further enhancements or any other functionality additions.
