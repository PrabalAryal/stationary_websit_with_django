# Stationary Items Selling Website

This is an example project on a Stationary Items selling website. Users can select from a wide variety of stationary items, sell items, and buy new items, etc.

The tech stack used for this project includes Python (Django) and MongoDB for the database.

## Project Status

As of now, the work on this project has been completed. The item selling section is left untouched as I do not possess any stocks or items which can be displayed. This project is concluded for now and may be revisited in the future for further enhancements or functionality additions.
